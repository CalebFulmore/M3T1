## Dataman Project
A fun, educational emulation of the 70s kids' toy, Dataman, now in a modern program form. Aimed to be engaging for kids and a tool parents can appreciate for its educational value. 

The original Dataman, released in the late 1970s, was not just a toy but an educational tool. It presented math problems, ranging from simple addition to complex division, and expected kids to input the correct answer. Beyond its educational aspect, Dataman was equipped with games to ensure that learning was a fun activity. With this project, we aim to bring back the nostalgia and learning value of Dataman in a modern, digital format.
